            <h4>
                NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Maths Chapter 1: Relations and Functions 
            </h4>
            <p>
                The first chapter of CBSE Class 12 deals with the concept of relationships and functions, domains, co-domains, 
                and boundaries with a variety of real-value functions and their associated graphs already introduced in the 
                11th-grade curriculum. In this chapter, you will solve four practice questions by combining those four 
                essential elements.

                NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Maths Chapter 2: Inverse Trigonometric Functions 
            </h4>
            <p>
                There are many functions that do not have one, or both, so we cannot talk about their inverse. In class 11, it 
                was studied that trigonometric functions are absent from each other and at their natural domains and boundaries, 
                and therefore have no inversions. There are only two exercises that you can study about the domains and 
                boundaries of the CBSE Class 12 inverted trigonometric functions, trigonometric functions, which reflect the 
                visibility of their inversions and observe their behavior through graphical representations. In addition, some 
                basic features will also be discussed. Inverted trigonometric functions are very important in calculus to 
                define multiple integrals. The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions are widely applied in science and 
                engineering.

            <p>
                You need to know mathematics because it is important in different areas of mathematics. Mathematics is 
                considered one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This makes our work much easier compared 
                to other methods. There are a total of 62 questions in Exercises 4 of this chapter. In this chapter, 
                you will delve deeper into the basics of Matrix and Matrix Algebra.

                In Chapter 3, the matrices of matrices and algebra are described. In this chapter, however, you will 
                study how to determine only three entries with actual entries. In addition, the six exercises are 
                distributed so that you can find the properties of a triangle, the components, the proximity of the 
                square matrix, and the determinants of the inverse, the cofactors, and the different applications 
                of the system. Linear equations. Studies and solves linear equations in two or three variables using 
                the inverse of the matrix in these exercises.

            <h4>NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Maths Chapter 5: Continuity and Differentiability </h4>
            <p>
                This chapter is an extension of the differentiation of the works you read in tenth grade. You can learn to 
                distinguish certain functions between polynomial functions and trigonometric functions. This chapter 
                describes the most important aspects of continuity, diversity, and the relationship between them. You 
                will learn about the differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions. In addition, you will be familiar 
                with a new class of functions called Exponential and Logarithmic Functions. There are a total of eight 
                exercises in this chapter, so you need to devote some extra time and effort to practice with this chapter.

            <p>
                In Chapter 5, you will learn how to get mixed functions, derivative functions, exponential functions, inverse 
                trigonometric functions, and logarithmic functions. In this chapter, you will study the applications of 
                derivatives in engineering, science and many other fields. For example, we learn how to use the derivative 
                to determine the rate of change of a quantity and find the tangents of a curve at one point and the equations 
                of the ordinary and many derivatives. We also use the derivative to find the interval to increase or 
                decrease functions. There are all five exercises where you will find detailed information on the derivatives 
                application. Finally, derivatives are used to find the approximate value of some quantities.
